# Culinary Recommendation System: Cooking Made Easy for International Students

## Introduction:
Our project addresses the culinary dilemmas faced by international students, who often find themselves in unfamiliar kitchens with limited knowledge of recipes and ingredients. Through the innovative use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our system offers a seamless solution for meal planning and recipe recommendations. By simply uploading images of available vegetables or manually inputting ingredients, users can access a curated list of top recipes tailored to their resources and preferences.

## Purpose:
The primary motivation behind our project is to empower international students with the confidence and capability to cook nutritious and delicious meals, even with minimal culinary experience or ingredients at hand. Recognizing the challenges of adapting to new environments, especially in terms of food culture, our system serves as a digital sous chef, guiding users through the cooking process with ease and efficiency.

## Key Features:
1. **Image Recognition:** Leveraging CNN technology, our system accurately identifies vegetables from uploaded images, eliminating the need for manual ingredient lists.
2. **Recipe Customization:** Users can specify dietary preferences and restrictions, ensuring that recommended recipes align with their individual tastes and nutritional needs.
3. **Ingredient-Based Recommendations:** Whether users have a fully stocked pantry or just a few items in the fridge, our system generates recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing food waste.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** With an intuitive and user-friendly interface, our project caters to individuals of all skill levels, from novice cooks to seasoned chefs, providing step-by-step instructions and visual aids for each recipe.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our Culinary Recommendation System revolutionizes the way international students approach cooking, offering a practical solution for meal planning and recipe discovery. By harnessing the power of CNNs and machine learning algorithms, we aim to foster culinary independence and creativity among users, enabling them to explore new flavors and cuisines with confidence and convenience.
